# key_scanner_plugin for Android

Plugin for scanning nearby bluetooth device Including (Android 10.), but the location service must be enabled.
In my case, I use this plugin for finding my board project (the 'key board' with HC-05 bluetooth device's) so we can track the device using bluetooth signal strength (RSSI) and then convert it to distance (meter). If our distance to device is less then 2 meters, we can hear the Beep Sound from the Buzzer that I use in my device too.
